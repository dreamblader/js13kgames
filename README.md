My Experience:  
My first game ever in a JAM and also my first experience at js13kgames.
I really want to improve this alot, making an entire game inside 13KB is an awesome challenge and a though one too. I hope you guys enjoy this silly game.  
I want to thank Jom to make the music loop and also apologize to my incompetence to transform the MIDI into something that would be played in the game.  
Next time I will pay extra attention to the audio.

Description:  
[*insert generic character name here*] in his endless run to some goal (I guess) just remembered that he forgot to turn off his stove.
Of course is easier to keep the momentum and run backwards (speedrunning tactics).
Help him to achieve that.  
SPOILERS: This is a endless runners, you will never help him.
